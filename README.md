## How to use

The script is simple to understand and use. It can be utilized to its full functionality without opening/editing source code. Isn't that great?

Here is how you achieved this :

The project mantains a separate file for list of URLs/Domains, so anytime you want to add any new URL/s or remove existing URL/s you just need to edit that text file and add a new URL on a new line and the script is ready for use.
The script will automatically detect underlying Operting System to determine the host file's directory. So you don't need to update the source code based on your OS and it will be taken care smoothly.
Once the script is executed successfully and the prompt is accepted, unless and until you want the filtering to don't work, the filtering will continue to work.
Even if by mistake the cancel command was send to script for termination of filtering, a prompt will be displayed to confirm the disable action.
On disabling the content filtering, normal functioning on your browser will apply automatically and you dont need to verify that its working or not.

## Get Started in 3 Steps! ðŸš€

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Harshitha205/Website-Blocker-using-python.git](https://github.com/Harshitha205/Website-Blocker-using-python.git)
    cd Website-Blocker-using-python/
    ```
2.  **Build Your Blocklist:** Open up `urllist.txt` and simply list the websites you want to block, one domain per line.
3.  **Run as Administrator/Root:** Because it's modifying a system file, you'll need to run the script with **administrator or root privileges**. But remember, these changes are only for the moment!
    ```bash
    python websiteblocker.py
    ```
    Confirm when it asks, and then dive into a wonderfully distraction-free Browse session! If you hit any snags, don't hesitate to check out the Issues section right here on GitHub.
