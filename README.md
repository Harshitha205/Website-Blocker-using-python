## How It Works: It's Smart and Safe ðŸ”’

At its core, this script cleverly tweaks your system's **hosts file** â€“ but don't worry, it's all **temporary and non-persistent**. When you flip the "on" switch, it subtly redirects those distracting website requests, effectively blocking them. What's neat is how lightweight it is. Your system's settings automatically snap back to normal once you end the blocking session. You're always in charge, and those changes only stick around while the script is actively running.

## What You Get: Benefits & Features âœ…

* **Instant Control:** Want to block a site? Just run the script, answer a quick "yes," and you're good to go. Need to unblock? Just as easy.
* **Customizable Blocklist:** Manage your list of blocked URLs and domains in a plain text file (`urllist.txt`). Update it anytime, and your changes are recognized immediately by the script.
* **Universal Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across **Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions**, automatically adapting to your operating system.
* **Zero System Impact:** All changes to your `hosts` file are temporary. Your internet access returns to normal as soon as the script is terminated or you choose to disable filtering.
* **Safe & User-Friendly:** We've even added a little confirmation step if you try to disable blocking, just to make sure you don't accidentally cut off your focus mid-task.
