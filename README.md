## How to use

The project keeps a separate file for the list of URLs/Domains, so whenever you wish to add new URLs or remove current ones, you simply need to modify that text file by adding a new URL on a new line, and the script will be ready to use. The script will automatically identify the underlying operating system to locate the host file's directory, eliminating the need for you to alter the source code according to your OS; this process is handled seamlessly. Once the script runs successfully and the prompt is acknowledged, the filtering will continue to operate until you choose to disable it. Even if the cancel command is mistakenly sent to terminate the filtering process, a prompt will appear to verify the disable action. Upon disabling the content filtering, your browser will automatically revert to normal functionality, and you wonâ€™t have to check whether it is working or not.

## Get Started in 3 Steps! ðŸš€

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Harshitha205/Website-Blocker-using-python.git](https://github.com/Harshitha205/Website-Blocker-using-python.git)
    cd Website-Blocker-using-python/
    ```
2.  **Build Your Blocklist:** Open up `urllist.txt` and simply list the websites you want to block, one domain per line.
3.  **Run as Administrator/Root:** Because it's modifying a system file, you'll need to run the script with **administrator or root privileges**. But remember, these changes are only for the moment!
    ```bash
    python websiteblocker.py
    ```
    Confirm when it asks, and then dive into a wonderfully distraction-free Browse session! If you hit any snags, don't hesitate to check out the Issues section right here on GitHub.
